Feature: Autocompletion of share-with names
As a user
I want to share files, with minimal typing, to the right people or groups
So that I can efficiently share my files with other users or groups

	Background:
		Given these users have been created but not initialized:
			| username    | password | displayname  | email                 |
			| user1       | 1234     | User One     | u1@oc.com.np          |
			| user2       | 1234     | User Two     | u2@oc.com.np          |
			| user3       | 1234     | User Three   | u2@oc.com.np          |
			| usergrp     | 1234     | User Grp     | u@oc.com.np           |
			| regularuser | 1234     | User Regular | regularuser@oc.com.np |
		And these groups have been created:
			|groupname|
			|group1     |
			|group2     |
			|group3     |
			|groupuser  |
		And the user has browsed to the login page
		And the user has logged in with username "regularuser" and password "1234" using the webUI
